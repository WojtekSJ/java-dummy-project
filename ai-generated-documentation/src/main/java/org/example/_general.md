## General Documentation for example package

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the `example` package, detailing its functionalities, structure, and usage guidelines. The package consists of two core components: `Client` and `Service`.  The `Client` class acts as an interface for users to interact with the `Service` object. It handles user input, validates it, and utilizes the `Service`'s capabilities to generate greetings based on the provided name. The `Service` class encapsulates the logic for determining if a given name length is even and constructs appropriate greeting messages. 

The package emphasizes clear code structure, modularity, and well-defined interfaces, making it easy to understand and integrate into other projects.
